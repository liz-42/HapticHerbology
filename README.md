# HapticHerbology

First iteration:
- The code in the master branch renders texture using vertical and horizontal lines, which the end effector can pass through so it feels like bumpy ridges. Note that this code does not use the Fisica library.
- Backgrounds in the master branch code can be changed using the keys 1, 2, and 3, where 1 corresponds to just vertical lines, 2 corresponds to the black and white bark image, and 3 to the original image.
