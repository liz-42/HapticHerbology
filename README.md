# HapticHerbology

First iteration:
- The code in liz-iteration-1 renders texture using vertical and horizontal lines, which the end effector can pass through so it feels like bumpy ridges. Note that this code does not use the Fisica library.
- Backgrounds in the master branch code can be changed using the keys 1, 2, and 3, where 1 corresponds to just vertical lines, 2 corresponds to the black and white bark image, and 3 to the original image.


Second iteration: 
- Elizabeth's work is in liz-iteration-2, and Jeremey's work is in image-processing
- For the code in liz-iteration-2: pressing the key 1 will show the lines over top of the black and white image, pressing 2 will show just the black and white image, and pressing 3 will show the colour image. The image can also be changed to one of 7 different oak trees by pressing the right and left arrow keys

Third iteration: 
- The code from the final iteration is in the master branch
- To run the code as an experiment (do not display tree facts between trials), set the variable experiment = true. Otherwise, the correct answer and a tree fact will appear between trials, as would be consistent with the final interface
- To show the underlying line forces and the real image, press p. 


Finally, the version of the STEM learning interface with the most effective rendering method for each tree type is in the STEM_Interface branch. Oak trees and cedar trees use the two line method, chestnut uses the random line method, and aspen uses the single line method.
